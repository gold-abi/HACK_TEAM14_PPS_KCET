Segment individuals into clusters based on their eating habits.  Your Google Form should ask:
 

Preference for veg/non-veg
Frequency of outside food 
Water intake per day 
Interest in healthy eating(scale 1-5)
Sleep time per day

Use K-Means to identify groups like "Healthy Eaters","Junk Food Lovers", etc. Visualize the clusters if possible
